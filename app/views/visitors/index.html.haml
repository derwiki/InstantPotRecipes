        I'm always on the go and sometimes it's hard to find time to cook. The
        Instant Pot lets me squeeze four hours of cooking into 30 minutes. What
        a life saver!

        The Instant Pot is more like a no-pressure cooker! The 8 quart makes
        it easy to cook for my family of six, and it makes everyone happy.

        The Instant Pot lets me cook 3x as much food in half the time! Perfect
        for pig's feet and it replaces my rice cooker entirely. Great for hosting
        small dinner parties!

        Before I bought my Instant Pot, cooking really intimidated me. But the
        Instant Pot is really dummy proof, and I can easily whip up chili
        and ratatouille.
